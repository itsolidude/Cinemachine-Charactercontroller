# Custom Cinemachine Freelook Camera Control in Unity

## My Journey with Cinemachine

Hello! Welcome to my little corner where I share my custom script for the Freelook Camera in Unity, built on top of Cinemachine's default camera script. Like many others, I was frustrated with the annoying jitter that came with the default setup. Determined to fix this, I embarked on a deep dive into the world of overcomplicated quaternion youtube videos and documentations and camera movements in Unity until I felt like throwing my machine out the window. It was a lot of research and learning, but finally, I came up with a solution that smoothed things out.

## Why I Tackled This Project

- **The Jitter Problem:** That jitter was more than a minor annoyance â€“ it was making the game unenjoyable. I knew there had to be a way to fix it.
- **Deep Dive into Quaternions:** Getting my head around quaternions was no small feat, but understanding them was key to keeping my sanity and solving the jitter issue.
- **Making It User-Friendly:** I wanted to create something that anyone could use in their project with ease, eliminating the frustration I went through, to safe you from a borderline meltdown.

## Setting Up My Script

1. **Start with Cinemachine:** Put a Cinemachine Freelook Camera in your scene.
2. **Attach My Improved Script:** Drag my `PlayerMove` script onto your player.
3. **Adjust to Your Liking:** Use the Unity Inspector to fine-tune settings for your game.
4. **Experience Smooth Camera Control:** Enjoy the fruits of my labor with smooth, jitter-free camera movement.
